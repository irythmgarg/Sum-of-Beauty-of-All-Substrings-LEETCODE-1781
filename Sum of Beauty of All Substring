Explanation:
Outer Loop:

The outer loop iterates through all starting indices i of the substrings in the input string s.
Inner Loop:

The inner loop iterates through all ending indices j for each starting index i.
For each character in the substring s[i...j], its frequency is incremented in the frequency array freq.
Finding Most Frequent and Least Frequent Values:

The mostval variable tracks the maximum frequency of any character in the current substring.
The leastval variable tracks the minimum frequency of any character that appears at least once.
Beauty Calculation:

The beauty of a substring is defined as the difference between the most frequent and least frequent character counts.
If mostval > leastval, the difference is added to the total beauty sum ans.
Return Value:

After iterating through all substrings, the total beauty sum ans is returned.
Time Complexity:
Outer loop runs O(n) times.
Inner loop runs up to O(n) times for each iteration of the outer loop.
Calculating the leastval in the inner loop takes O(26) (constant).
Overall complexity: O(nÂ²).
Space Complexity:
Frequency array freq uses O(26) space for each substring.
Total space complexity: O(1) (constant space, as freq is reused).
